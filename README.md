## My process

### Built with

- Mobile First
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
### Continued development

It was a good practice for flexbox. I've got a hang of using flexbox in designs. First think of the design, draw it on paper if you cannot visualize and once set start coding.
